# AI-Assisted Market Research System

## Why This Exists
Traditional price prediction models (LSTMs, ARIMA, indicators) fail due to market noise and exogenous events.

This system uses LLMs to:
- Compress information
- Highlight catalysts
- Reduce research time

## What This Is NOT
❌ Not a trading bot  
❌ Not price prediction  
❌ No guaranteed profitability  

## What It Does
- Pulls market news
- Analyzes it via ChatGPT
- Posts structured research to Discord

## Setup
1. Clone repo
2. Create `.env`
3. Install dependencies
4. Run `python main.py`

## Example Output
